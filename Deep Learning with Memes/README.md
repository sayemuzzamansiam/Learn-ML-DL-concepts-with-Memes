# Deep Learning Memes - Coming Soon

Welcome to the **Deep Learning** folder! 

Currently, this folder is a work in progress... just like a neural network in the middle of training. All the memes are still in the *hidden layers* and haven't been fully activated yet.

## Whatâ€™s happening here?

Right now, weâ€™re training our deep learning models, and the memes are still in the *backpropagation phase*â€”but don't worry, they'll be here soon!

---

### What's next?

Weâ€™ll be adding memes on topics like:
- Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Backpropagation
- Overfitting and Underfitting (because who doesnâ€™t like a good bias-variance joke?)

### A Little Meme to Keep You Going

_"Why did the neural network break up with the decision tree?"_

Because it found someone with *deeper connections*. ðŸ˜œ

---

Stay tuned for more memes as we fine-tune the network and get these DL concepts delivered straight to your brain (or at least your funny bone). ðŸ§

### P.S.
If you donâ€™t see memes yet, donâ€™t worryâ€”itâ€™s just the dropout layer working its magic! More memes are on their way!
